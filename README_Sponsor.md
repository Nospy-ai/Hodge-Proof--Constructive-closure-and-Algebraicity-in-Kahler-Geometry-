## Executive Overview
**HodgeClean** is a next-generation research framework that reconstructs algebraic closure relations and symbolic correspondences underlying genus-2 systems.  
Developed entirely in **SageMath**, it integrates advanced algebraic geometry, computational number theory, and reproducibility verification.
---
## Technical Highlights
- 100% reproducible SHA-256 manifest tracking  
- Automated LaTeX + PDF generation of research papers  
- Verified symbolic/algebraic origin reconstruction (Phase X)  
- Integrated verification reports with cryptographic checksums  
---
## Deliverables
- Final bundle: `HodgeClean_Final_Package_*.zip`  
  Contains verified LaTeX paper, manifests, and source artifacts  
- OA Prototype: provides early-stage empirical data  
- Combined package: `Sponsor_Bundle.zip` (optional export cell can build this)
---
## Environment Requirements
- **Platform:** CoCalc or local SageMath 10.7 installation  
- **Dependencies:** Python 3.12, reportlab, numpy, mpmath, matplotlib, LaTeX  
---
## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone or extract the working directory  
2. Launch in CoCalc / Jupyter  
3. Run all cells sequentially — build completes automatically  
4. Final ZIP is created and validated at end of run  
---
## Research Direction
The framework demonstrates a potential constructive route toward Hodge-type correspondence through explicit field recognition.  
Phase XI will extend this into higher-genus and Ω-normalization territory.
